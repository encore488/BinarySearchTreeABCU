# BinarySearchTreeABCU
Implementation of a binary search tree.
ABCUcourses.cpp: It is the main program. Let me know if you have any suggestions to improve code aesthetic or functionality.

Pseudocode_Analyze_CS300.doc: It is pseudocode and big O analyses to explore whether we should be using a binary search tree, a vector, or a hashtable for this application.

ABCUprograms.csv: A CSV file made to represent the courses at a fictional university. This is where we are taking values from to make the binary tree.

The other two files are for CSV parsing. I did not write them. This is part of a DSA course at Southern New Hampshire University.
