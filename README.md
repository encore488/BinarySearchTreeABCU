# BinarySearchTreeABCU
Implementation of a binary search tree.
I created ABCUcourses.cpp and Pseudocode_Analyze_CS300.doc. The other files are just necessary to run. One is the CSV file we are taking values from to make the binary tree and the other two are for CSV parsing. This is part of a DSA course at Southern New Hampshire University.
The .doc file is pseudocode and big O analyses to explore whether we should be using a binary search tree, a vector, or a hashtable for this application.
