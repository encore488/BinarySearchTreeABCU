# BinarySearchTreeABCU
Implementation of a binary search tree.
ABCUcourses.cpp: It is the main program. Let me know if you have any suggestions to improve code aesthetic or functionality.

Pseudocode_Analyze_CS300.doc: It is pseudocode and big O analyses to explore whether we should be using a binary search tree, a vector, or a hashtable for this application.

ABCUprograms.csv: A CSV file made to represent the courses at a fictional university. This is where we are taking values from to make the binary tree.

The other two files are for CSV parsing. I did not write them. This is part of a DSA course at Southern New Hampshire University.

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
ABCU needed a way to efficiently store information on their course offerings. They also needed an interface to retrieve this information.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I analyzed the time complexity of using a vector, a hashtable, or a binary search tree. I also wrote pseudocode to explore each option.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I spoke to tutors a couple of times. I also looked on Stack Overflow a few times. My favorite trick though, is to write comments or pseudocode before writing before writing any functioning code.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
It has given me a basis for understanding data structures and algorithms and when and how to implement them. It has also taught me more about the importance of pseudocode, which I keep managing to underestimate.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
The main difference is that I now always write pseudocode by hand before programming. I also have learned to write less comments. Too many unnecessary comments distract from the real action.
